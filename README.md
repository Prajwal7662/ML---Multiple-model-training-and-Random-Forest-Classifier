Multiple Model Training & Random Forest Classifier
ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project explores two key concepts in machine learning:

Multiple Model Training â€“ where different algorithms are trained and evaluated on the same dataset to compare performance.

Random Forest Classifier â€“ a powerful ensemble method used to improve prediction accuracy by combining multiple decision trees.

The dataset used is the Tips dataset from Seaborn, and the goal is to predict whether the meal time is Lunch or Dinner based on customer and billing features.

ðŸš€ Project Workflow
1. Data Loading & Exploration

Loaded the Tips dataset from Seaborn.

Explored structure, datatypes, and missing values.

2. Data Preprocessing

Converted categorical variables into numerical form using Label Encoding.

Checked for missing values.

Prepared feature matrix X and target variable y.

3. Multiple Model Training

Trained and evaluated several models:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Naive Bayes

Compared models using accuracy score and evaluation metrics.

4. Random Forest Classifier

Implemented Random Forest Classifier as a separate experiment.

Tuned key hyperparameters (e.g., number of trees, max depth).

Evaluated performance with:

Accuracy

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report

ðŸ“Š Key Libraries Used

pandas â€“ Data manipulation

numpy â€“ Numerical operations

matplotlib & seaborn â€“ Data visualization

scikit-learn â€“ Machine learning algorithms and evaluation

ðŸ“ˆ Results

Multiple Model Training: Gave an overview of how different ML algorithms perform on the dataset.

Random Forest Classifier: Showed strong performance due to its ensemble approach.

ðŸ”® Future Improvements

Add cross-validation for better model comparison.

Perform Grid Search / Random Search hyperparameter tuning.

Extend dataset or apply the same pipeline to a different dataset.
